Open Elections Python/Django Application Sample Data File

Note: This is an edited XML file for testing with the open_elections program.
(see: https://github.com/KPBS/open_elections)

This file contains AP results for the most recent General Presidential Election.

We make no promises that it is representative of future AP election results xml files.

Happy coding!
